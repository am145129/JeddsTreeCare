  <h2>Emerald Ash Bore</h2>
  <p>Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire,
     is an exotic beetle that was discovered in southeastern Michigan near Detroit in the summer of 2002.
      The adult beetles nibble on ash foliage but cause little damage.
      The larvae (the immature stage) feed on the inner bark of ash trees,
      disrupting the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients.</p>

   <p>Emerald ash borer probably arrived in the United States on solid wood packing material carried in cargo ships or airplanes originating in its native Asia.
     As of October 2018, it is now found in 35 states, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario,
     Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Manitoba.</p>

        <p>Emerald ash borer (EAB) infestation is a major concern for American Indian people.
           Many American Indian cultures and traditions rely on ash trees for the wood needed for making baskets,
            lacrosse sticks, pipe stems, flutes, and medicinal remedies. The ash tree is a central figure in some traditional
             and religious stories told by several American Indian tribes.</p>
             
             <p>The Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis or EAB) is responsible for the destruction of tens of millions of ash
                trees in 30 states. The first U.S. identification of Emerald Ash Borer was in southeastern Michigan in 2002.
                 There are a variety of treatment options that can serve as a control measure for the EAB, but they are not a cure.
                  Because pesticide regulations differ from State to State, homeowners should contact their State department
                   of agriculture or local extension office for guidance.</p>
